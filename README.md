I. test_simulation_session1.m contains two parts: 1. data acquisition from EEG amplifier 
                                                  2. simulating data acquisition from disk(file DJ18);
   !!!! when you excute this function, don't forget open the buffer application which is located in the fieldtrip\realtime\bin\mac\buffer
                                               
II. sessions_gui.m reads EEG data from fieldtrip buffer in a detected window, then plot the EEG epoch in the GUI interface.
